# MMathStat-Project

This is the code used to complete my dissertation, Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods to Assess Gerrymandering, submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of MMathStat Honours in the School of Mathematics, Statistics and Physics at Newcastle University. 

The example code shows the simulated annealing algorithm run on a simpler example model, that data for which is also avaliable. 
The North Carolina code shows the simulated annealing algorithm run on the 2012 United States House of Representatives elections in North Carolina, that data for which was collected from the North Carolina General Assembly (https://www.ncleg.gov/Redistricting/BaseData2011).
